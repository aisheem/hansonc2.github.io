# POLITICS
## Background 🏛

We wanted to explore how the data brokerage industry cashes in on political  advertising.  Since, 2008, online political advertising has become increasingly important, with political campaigns spending tens of billions of dollars each year to push political ads. What do theses data brokers who collaborate with political campaigns know about you?  According to the Washington Post, RNC allegedly has [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/27/political-campaign-data-targeting/]3000 data points(https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/27/political-campaign-data-targeting/) on every US voter

## Study Questions ❓

We wanted to answer:

> How do differences in personal characteristics (Race, Age, Gender) affect the type of political targeted advertising?   

> Is there an attempt to sway a user away from their affiliation, or do advertisers simply serve to build on existing political leanings?   

## Experiment 🧪
To run experiments, we use a modified version of AdFisher[https://github.com/hansonc2/info-flow-experiments](https://github.com/hansonc2/info-flow-experiments) to create and automate accounts specific to onw of five points on the political spectrum. We then observe advertisements and categorize them by type. Our data and tools can bes found below.
